Goals:

1. Make CLI print by location, class category, or time (evening, afternoon, morning)
2. When CLI prints all classes, print location first then print all classes at that location
    - to do this: create location class? Or just build a method in fitness_class.rb that collects all classes within a location and returns
3. with phantomjs there is a delay to load the classes. can we use json or something to make it faster?
4. to deal with load time, create a progress bar. or only load classes at specific locations to speed up process.
    or print after each location is loaded.
